        </ul>

          <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
          <li>2 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
          <li>1/3 cup butter, softened</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Icing:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1 package cream cheese, softened</li>
          <li>1.4 cup butter, softened</li>
          <li>1.5 cups confectioner's sugar</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
          <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>
          <li>Prepare pie crust by mixing together the flour and salt. 
              Cut shortening into flour; add cold water 1 tablespoon at a time 
              (you may need only 3 tablespoons, or up to 4 tablespoons). 
              Mix dough and repeat until dough is moist enough to hold together.</li>
          <li>With lightly floured, hands shape dough into a ball. On a lightly floured 
              board roll dough out to about 1/8 inch thickness. With a sharp knife, 
              cut dough 1 1/2 inch larger than the upside-down 8- to 9-inch pie pan. 
              Gently roll the dough around the rolling pin and transfer it right-side up 
              onto the pie pan. Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pie pan.</li>
          <li>In a large bowl, beat pumpkin with evaporated milk, eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, 
              ginger, nutmeg and salt with an electric mixer or immersion blender. Mix well. 
              Pour into a prepared crust. Bake 40 minutes or until when a knife is inserted 1 
              inch from the edge comes out clean.</li>
      </ol>
